1. **Fetch Updates from Remote:** Start by fetching the latest updates from the remote repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date information about all branches.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Switch to the Branch:** If you are not already on the `store-player-stats` branch, switch to it using the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout store-player-stats
   ```

3. **Merge Remote Changes:** Merge the changes from the remote `store-player-stats` branch into your local branch:

   ```bash
   git merge origin/store-player-stats
   ```

   This will incorporate the changes from the remote branch into your local branch.

4. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):** If there are conflicts during the merge, you will need to resolve them by editing the affected files, marking the conflicts as resolved, and then committing the changes.

   ```bash
   # After resolving conflicts
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

5. **Push Changes to Remote:** If everything merges cleanly, you can then push the changes back to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin store-player-stats
   ```

Now, your local `store-player-stats` branch should be updated with the changes from the remote branch. You can continue working on this branch, making further changes or testing without affecting the `main` branch. When you're ready, you can merge your changes from `store-player-stats` into the `main` branch.
